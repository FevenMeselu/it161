      <h2 class="subheader">Biography!</h2>
      <p> Filmon Adelehey was born and raised in Asmara, the capitol city of Eritrea. His father drove
        a delivery truck and his mother took care of their apartment, him, and
        his four brothers and sisters. As a child of six or seven, he developed
        an interest in drawing and using burnt bits of wood, would draw on walls
        of his neighborhood’s buildings. Within a short time, he discovered
        color and was able to use colored pencils and crayons to create
        portraits on these same walls.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the age of fourteen, outside of his academic classes, he enrolled in
        an art school in Asmara. The class was comprised of local university art
        students, whereas Adelehey was the equivalent of a freshman in an
        American high school. Upon completion of the school’s courses, he
        graduated within a year. For the next ten years he dedicated himself to
        his art, hopeful of one day becoming a professional artist. Intent on
        delving more deeply into his subject as an artist portraying the human
        experience, he observed people – his family, neighbors, friends,
        strangers – attentive to their faces, the emotional content of their
        character.
